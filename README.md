# Visualizing-COVID19
Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely?

This project focuses on manipulating dataframes using "dplyr" and make plots using "ggplot2".

## Results:

In depth comparison of China vs Rest of the World (hardest hit countries) as of Mid-March 2020.
